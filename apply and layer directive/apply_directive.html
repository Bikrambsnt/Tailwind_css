<!-- Apply directive can be used to craete a single class from more than a one class simply we can wrap lots of classes on a single class -->

<!-- apply diective provides re-usability of a same code  instead of writing same line of css again and again -->

<!-- apply directve can be created by wrapping more than one class on a new class on a input.css file after the @tailwind components and
 before the @tailwind utilities-->

 <!-- This is because when the browser read the css file it will read @tailwind component first then it will add all the taiwind css after that it will read our created class and the utility class
  
 if we want to add our craeted class first then we can lace it accordingly before the components or after the utilities -->

 <!-- Example -->

 <!DOCTYPE html>
 <html lang="en">
 <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

 </head>
 <body>

    <button type="button" class= " m-20 px-10 py-8 bg-red-400 rounded-md hover:bg-yellow-400">Button</button>
    <!-- Now if I want another button then I will just add this above class on input.css file by creating my custom then then I will add that class on another button -->
    <button class="btn">Button 2</button>    
 </body>
 </html>

<!-- This is how I can use @apply directive -->
